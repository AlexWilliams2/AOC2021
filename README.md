%% AOC2021 Solutions in Erlang, because after 3 years working on AMS I no longer remember how to code in anything else.

1. Place your input for a given day in a file called "input<day>.txt" in the checkout directory e.g. "input2.txt".
2. Start BEAM with `erl`
3. Compile using `c("input.erl").` and `c("day1.erl").`
4. Run using `day1:day1(1)` for first puzzle and `day1:day1(2)` for second etc

Code style tips welcome
